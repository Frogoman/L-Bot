You are making me jealous...
Did you know that she is a cat?
Why are you talking to her?
She knows everything...
Stop! No touchy the space cat!
Bubble tea! Hah! Why are you looking at me like that...
Psst! She is busy!
You know she can hear you, right?
Her tail is so fluffy!!
You know if you talk to her too much, I will tentacle you.
Don't look at me... but we are out of coffee.
I don't like that look in your eyes! Why do you need her?
She will eat your face!
