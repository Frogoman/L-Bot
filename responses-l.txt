Music starto....
I dont understand
I don't like the moon. It's lonely.
I am not really an octocat.
I don't eat humans! Shy won't let me!
I hunger.
Why does everyone want to touch my tentacle?
I dont understand
Do you have a snack?
No... I don't need an eyedrop.
Earth is a strange place.
I can look like anything... but too much of me scares people.
Plants are beautiful... but Shy forgets to water them all the time.
Can I help?
I like to touch the coffee.
Why are you persistent?
She is way too into spooky stories... should I look scarier?
I ate some spaghetti. It was nice and crunchy!
Oh Nyo~
I like watching movies! You can rewatch people move over and over and over and over... ah...
Shy's hair smells nice, so I ate her shampoo. I hiccuped bubbles for a week!
I don't feel homesick anymore. I am home.
We don't actually have facehuggers on the station... at least I don't think so.
-Hiccup- I ate a block of soap.
Humans are so fragile...
Never gonna give you up! Never gonna let you down! Never gonna let you touch my space cat...
I did eat her safety skirt. I have no regrets. Please don't tell her...
My name is Alheitrakzoth.
